Using machine learning technics to try to predict an anomaly  in some server browsing by the clinets we are like improving the firewall work



## Framework
Tensorflow 

## Usage

Just run ``python3 demo2.py`` to see the results:

To visulaze your Graph in tensorboard just run ``tensorboard --logdir=/tmp/mnist_tutorial/``
wich the path depends on what you have set in the code "Logdir"
